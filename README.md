# 🚀 My AWS Re/Start Journey: What I'm Learning

I'm going through a curriculum that's giving me a comprehensive foundation in **cloud computing**, **Linux**, **Python**, **networking**, **security**, and **professional skills**. This program is preparing me for entry-level cloud roles and the **AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner** exam.

## What I'm Learning

### 1. Linux Fundamentals 🐧

Building a solid foundation in the **Linux operating system** has been essential for my cloud journey. These are the core skills I'm developing to manage cloud servers and environments:

* **Command line basics** (CLI)
* **File systems and permissions** (like `chmod`, `chown`)
* **Process and service management** (using `ps`, `systemctl`)
* **Package management** (working with `apt`, `yum`)
* **Shell scripting basics**

### 2. Python Programming 🐍

Learning Python is enabling me to write **automation scripts** and manage cloud resources more efficiently. Here's what I'm covering:

* **Syntax and data types** (variables, lists, dictionaries)
* **Control flow** (loops and conditionals like `if-else`, `for`, `while`)
* **Functions and modules** (creating and importing them)
* **Error handling** (using `try-except` blocks)
* Writing simple **automation scripts**

### 3. Networking Basics 🌐

Understanding fundamental **networking principles** is crucial for designing, connecting, and securing cloud infrastructure. I'm learning about:

* **IP addressing & subnets** (CIDR notation)
* **DNS, DHCP, routing**
* **Firewalls & ports** (common protocols and ports)
* **OSI model fundamentals**

* **Networking in cloud environments** (like Virtual Private Clouds)

### 4. Security Concepts 🔒

I'm covering core **security principles** and cloud-specific security practices to ensure data and infrastructure protection:

* **IAM (Identity & Access Management)** principles
* **Least-privilege** principles
* **Encryption basics** (in-transit and at-rest)
* **Secure configurations**
* **Threat awareness & best practices**

### 5. AWS Cloud Services ☁️

This section is where I'm diving into the **core services** offered by Amazon Web Services and getting hands-on experience with the cloud platform.

| Category | Services I'm Learning |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Compute** | **EC2** (Elastic Compute Cloud) |
| **Storage** | **S3** (Simple Storage Service), **EBS** (Elastic Block Store) |
| **Databases** | **RDS** (Relational Database Service), **DynamoDB** basics |
| **Security** | **IAM** & security services |
| **Networking** | **VPC** (Virtual Private Cloud), subnets, **NACLs**, **Security Groups** |
| **Serverless** | **Lambda** (introduction) |
| **Monitoring** | **CloudWatch** |

### 6. Cloud Architecture Foundations 🏗️

I'm focusing on the concepts I need to build **well-architected solutions** that are reliable, secure, and cost-effective on AWS:

* **High availability** (HA)
* **Scalability & elasticity** (scaling up/out)
* **Fault tolerance** (DR planning)
* **Cost optimization principles**
* **Shared responsibility model**

### 7. Professional Skills 🤝

This part emphasizes the **soft skills** and business acumen I need for success and career growth in a professional IT environment:

* **Communication & teamwork**
* **Problem-solving** methodologies
* **Agile basics** (Scrum and Kanban overview)
* **Interview & career readiness** (resume writing, networking)
